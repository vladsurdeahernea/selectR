Description: Tools to propose "best" case(s) or pairs of cases for intensive
    within-case analysis, based on a transparent, algorithmic mapping of classic
    case-selection strategies: typical, diverse, extreme, deviant, influential,
    most-similar, most-different, outcome, index, longitudinal, and pathway.
    Returns ranked candidates with scores and rationales, and records a 7-step
    audit log for transparency.
