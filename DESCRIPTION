Description: Tools to propose "best" case(s) or pairs of cases for intensive within-case analysis,
    based on a transparent, algorithmic mapping of classic case-selection strategies:
    typical, diverse, extreme, deviant, influential, most-similar, most-different, outcome, index,
    longitudinal, and pathway. The API follows a formula-first design (Y ~ X | Z1 + Z2 + ...),
    returns ranked candidates with scores and rationales, and records a 7-step audit log for transparency.
    Methods reflect the goals/strategies typology and selection constraints in Table 1 of Gerring & Cojocaru (2016),
    and the quantitative procedures in Seawright & Gerring (2008).
